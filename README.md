# Automated Mortgage Payments

## ðŸ§¾ Project Description
The **Automated Mortgage Payments** smart contract streamlines and automates the process of paying off a mortgage through monthly cryptocurrency transactions. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, this contract allows a lender and borrower to engage in a transparent, time-based repayment plan with minimized risk and human intervention.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Vision
To revolutionize the traditional mortgage payment system by leveraging blockchain's transparency and automation, ensuring timely, tamper-proof, and trustless transactions between borrowers and lenders.

## âœ¨ Key Features
- **Automated Scheduling**: Payments are tied to blockchain timestamps and are only allowed when due.
- **Immutable Terms**: Mortgage terms like total amount and monthly installment are defined at contract deployment.
- **Lender Protection**: Only the lender can deploy the contract and only the borrower can make payments.
- **Event Logs**: Emits events on each payment and when the mortgage is fully paid off.
- **Real-Time Balance Check**: Borrowers can check their remaining balance and next due date anytime.

## ðŸš€ Future Scope
- **ERC-20 Integration**: Support stablecoin payments (e.g., USDC, DAI) to reduce ETH volatility risks.
- **Credit Score System**: Introduce a decentralized creditworthiness score based on payment history.
- **Multi-borrower or Co-signer Support**: Expand the system to handle more complex mortgage structures.
- **Penalty & Grace Period Handling**: Add logic for missed payments, late fees, or grace periods.
- **UI Dashboard**: Build a frontend interface for borrowers and lenders to interact with the contract seamlessly.
